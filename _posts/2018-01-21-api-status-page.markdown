Quite often in places I have worked the question was always asked whether the API or Website was up.

I created this small project to check whether a given URL was 'up' given a specific http status code.

It uses React, Semantic UI, Recharts on the client side, and NodeJS, ExpressJS and Postgres on the backend.
